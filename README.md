Marco Polo DNS Daemon
---------------------

Intro
-----

Marco Polo DNS Daemon is a DNS server, which can return different CNAME record based on DNS resolver's IP address and edns-client-subnet information.

Currently it supports three types: AS Number, Country Code, and Random.

* [Open source our Marco Polo DNS Daemon](https://kkbox.codes/archives/2016/07/04/open-source-our-marco-polo-dns-daemon/)

Install
-------

Install the following dependencies:

* libfile-write-rotate-perl (File::Write::Rotate)
* libgeoip2-perl (GeoIP2)
* libnet-dns-perl (Net::DNS) - Version 0.68 on Ubuntu 14.04 and eariler one are not new enough to work

Then just copy `lib/mpdnsd.pm` into `/usr/sbin/mpdnsd`.

Run
---

    /usr/sbin/mpdnsd \
        [--bind_host IP1,IP2,...] \
        [--cpu CPU] \
        [--nsrrs NS1.DOMAIN,NS2.DOMAIN,...] \
        [--port PORT] \
        [--querylog_file FILENAME] \
        [--service_domain SERVICE.DOMAIN] \
        [--ttl_asn SECONDS] \
        [--ttl_country SECONDS] \
        [--ttl_ns SECONDS] \
        [--ttl_random SECONDS] \
        [--whitelist_domain ONE.MP.DOMAIN,TWO.MP.DOMAIN]

For example:

    /usr/sbin/mpdnsd \
        --bind_host 0.0.0.0 \
        --nsrrs mp-ns1.example.com,mp-ns2.example.com \
        --service_domain mp.example.com \
        --whitelist_domain example.com

Use
---

You can get AS number by this example:

    dig test.example.com.asn.mp.example.com @mp-ns1.example.com

It will return a CNAME record to:

    12345.test.example.com

Which `12345` is AS number based on client's DNS resolver or edns-client-subnet information.

Also, you can get country code:

    dig test.example.com.country.mp.example.com @mp-ns1.example.com
    TW.test.example.com

And you can get the utc hour:

    dig test.example.com.hour.mp.example.com
    9.test.example.com

And you can choose randomly for range [0..10) (i.e. 0~9):

    dig test.example.com.r10.mp.example.com
    9.test.example.com
